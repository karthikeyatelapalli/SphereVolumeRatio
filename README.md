# Ratio of Volume of Spheres to Containers

This Python program demonstrates that the total volume of spheres is approximately 2/3 of the volume of a cylindrical container with an equivalent radius and height equal to the spheres' total diameter. The program takes user input for the number of spheres and their diameter, calculates the respective volumes, and displays the percentage of the container's volume occupied by the spheres.

## **Features**
1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - Calculates the total volume of multiple spheres.
   - Computes the volume of a cylindrical container with the same radius and height equal to the total diameter of the spheres.

2. **Percentage Occupancy**:
   - Calculates the percentage of the container's volume occupied by the spheres.

3. **User-Friendly Input and Output**:
   - Prompts the user to input the number of spheres and their diameter.
   - Displays the required container height and
